Classes, skills, and guilds:

When you enter the game the first time, you are asked to select a class; either
THIEF, WARRIOR, CLERIC, or MAGIC user. Characters belonging to each of these
classes have their own qualities, abilities, and handicaps.

In order to learn the tricks of your specific trade, you need to find your
GUILD, which may take a little exploring. However, you can usually find a 
guild in any reasonably populated city. Once you've found it, you need to
look up your guildmaster and PRACTICE.

Equipment:

It is never wise to travel without the proper equipment. You may purchase this
in the SHOPS.

About Staying Fit - Eating and Drinking:

At one time or another, you'll see the message "You are hungry". This means
that it's time to find something edible before too long. People don't starve
to death in this world, so have no fear. However, when you are hungry, you do
not build up lost energy, so eventually you'll be unable to do anything but sit
around and feel sorry for yourself, until someone comes by. Then, you can only
hope that it's a benevolent person, rather than a greedy thief or a warrior
lusting for blood.
